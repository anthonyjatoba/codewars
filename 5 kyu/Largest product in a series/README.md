# [Largest product in a series](https://www.codewars.com/kata/529872bdd0f550a06b00026e)
Complete the `greatestProduct` method so that it'll find the greatest product of five consecutive digits in the given string of digits.

For example:
```javascript
greatestProduct("123834539327238239583") // should return 3240
```
```haskell
greatestProduct "55493" `shouldBe` 5 * 5 * 4 * 9 * 3
greatestProduct "123834539327238239583" `shouldBe` 3240
```

The input string always has more than five digits.
